# libkazv (and the Kazv Project)

[libkazv](https://gitlab.com/kazv/libkazv) is a sans-io C++ (gnu++17) client library
built upon [lager](https://github.com/arximboldi/lager). Along with it there is
[kazv](https://gitlab.com/kazv/kazv), a kirigami/qml client, and a
[forward bot](https://gitlab.com/kazv/matrix-tencent-forward-bot) between matrix and
tencent qq. Talk to us on [#kazv:tusooa.xyz](https://matrix.to/#/#kazv:tusooa.xyz?via=tusooa.xyz).

## Updates

In the past (how many?) weeks we ("tusooa and her longcat," we hope someday we can
remove this annotation :P):

1. Released [libkazv 0.1.0][libkazv-010] and [matrix-tencent-forward-bot 0.1.0][mtfb-010].
