/*! \brief Create a new room
 *
 * Create a new room with various configuration options.
 * 
 * The server MUST apply the normal state resolution rules when creating
 * the new room, including checking power levels for each event. It MUST
 * apply the events implied by the request in the following order:
 * 
 * 1. The ``m.room.create`` event itself. Must be the first event in the
 *    room.
 * 
 * 2. An ``m.room.member`` event for the creator to join the room. This is
 *    needed so the remaining events can be sent.
 * 
 * 3. A default ``m.room.power_levels`` event, giving the room creator
 *    (and not other members) permission to send state events. Overridden
 *    by the ``power_level_content_override`` parameter.
 * 
 * 4. Events set by the ``preset``. Currently these are the ``m.room.join_rules``,
 *    ``m.room.history_visibility``, and ``m.room.guest_access`` state events.
 * 
 * 5. Events listed in ``initial_state``, in the order that they are
 *    listed.
 * 
 * 6. Events implied by ``name`` and ``topic`` (``m.room.name`` and ``m.room.topic``
 *    state events).
 * 
 * 7. Invite events implied by ``invite`` and ``invite_3pid`` (``m.room.member`` with
 *    ``membership: invite`` and ``m.room.third_party_invite``).
 * 
 * The available presets do the following with respect to room state:
 * 
 * ========================  ==============  ======================  ================  =========
 *          Preset           ``join_rules``  ``history_visibility``  ``guest_access``  Other
 * ========================  ==============  ======================  ================  =========
 * ``private_chat``          ``invite``      ``shared``              ``can_join``
 * ``trusted_private_chat``  ``invite``      ``shared``              ``can_join``      All invitees are given the same power level as the room creator.
 * ``public_chat``           ``public``      ``shared``              ``forbidden``
 * ========================  ==============  ======================  ================  =========
 * 
 * The server will create a ``m.room.create`` event in the room with the
 * requesting user as the creator, alongside other keys provided in the

  /*! \brief Create a new room
 *
    * \param visibility
    *   A ``public`` visibility indicates that the room will be shown
    *   in the published room list. A ``private`` visibility will hide
    *   the room from the published room list. Rooms default to
    *   ``private`` visibility if this key is not included. NB: This
    *   should not be confused with ``join_rules`` which also uses the
    *   word ``public``.
    * 
    * \param roomAliasName
    *   The desired room alias **local part**. If this is included, a
    *   room alias will be created and mapped to the newly created
    *   room. The alias will belong on the *same* homeserver which
    *   created the room. For example, if this was set to "foo" and
    *   sent to the homeserver "example.com" the complete room alias
    *   would be ``#foo:example.com``.
    *   
    *   The complete room alias will become the canonical alias for
    *   the room.
    * 
    * \param name
    *   If this is included, an ``m.room.name`` event will be sent
    *   into the room to indicate the name of the room. See Room
    *   Events for more information on ``m.room.name``.
    * 
    * \param topic
    *   If this is included, an ``m.room.topic`` event will be sent
    *   into the room to indicate the topic for the room. See Room
    *   Events for more information on ``m.room.topic``.
    * 
    * \param invite
    *   A list of user IDs to invite to the room. This will tell the
    *   server to invite everyone in the list to the newly created room.
    * 
    * \param invite3pid
    *   A list of objects representing third party IDs to invite into
    *   the room.
    * 
    * \param roomVersion
    *   The room version to set for the room. If not provided, the homeserver is
    *   to use its configured default. If provided, the homeserver will return a
    *   400 error with the errcode ``M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION`` if it does not
    *   support the room version.
    * 
    * \param creationContent
    *   Extra keys, such as ``m.federate``, to be added to the content
    *   of the `m.room.create`_ event. The server will clobber the following
    *   keys: ``creator``, ``room_version``. Future versions of the specification
    *   may allow the server to clobber other keys.
    * 
    * \param initialState
    *   A list of state events to set in the new room. This allows
    *   the user to override the default state events set in the new
    *   room. The expected format of the state events are an object
    *   with type, state_key and content keys set.
    *   
    *   Takes precedence over events set by ``preset``, but gets
    *   overriden by ``name`` and ``topic`` keys.
    * 
    * \param preset
    *   Convenience parameter for setting various default state events
    *   based on a preset.
    *   
    *   If unspecified, the server should use the ``visibility`` to determine
    *   which preset to use. A visbility of ``public`` equates to a preset of
    *   ``public_chat`` and ``private`` visibility equates to a preset of
    *   ``private_chat``.
    * 
    * \param isDirect
    *   This flag makes the server set the ``is_direct`` flag on the
    *   ``m.room.member`` events sent to the users in ``invite`` and
    *   ``invite_3pid``. See `Direct Messaging`_ for more information.
    * 
    * \param powerLevelContentOverride
    *   The power level content to override in the default power level
    *   event. This object is applied on top of the generated `m.room.power_levels`_
    *   event content prior to it being sent to the room. Defaults to
    *   overriding nothing.
